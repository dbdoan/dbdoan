😎 Hi there! I'm a Senior Computer Science student at the University of Houston with a passion for building innovative and practical tools. I specialize in Python development and love integrating it with social media platforms like Telegram and Discord to create useful automation, bots, and productivity tools.

💫 I enjoy developing projects that solve real-world problems and provide value to others, whether it's automating workflows, enhancing communication, or simplifying complex tasks.

🛠️ My interests include:

- Python development (automation, scripting, APIs)
- Social media integrations (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
- Building tools that help others
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks

💡 I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting projects and learn new things along the way. Feel free to check out my repos and connect with me!
